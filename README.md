The project is an analysis of the data streaming services Dysney, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon. I start with a general scan over all the given tables to see the structure
and contents of the different tables.
I then run join queries to combine the necessary data within the different tables
I conclude by rating the family friendliness of each streaming service according to the given genres, and find out that that disney is the best at almost 75%
